What are Generics in java?
Generics in java are a way to create classes , interfaces and methods that operate on types specifed at runtime rather than compile time.With generics , we can create more reusable code by not specifyinng exactly which data type will be handled at the time of definition of class or method or interface.It doesnot sacrifices the type-safety but still gives flexibility.

Why generics?
->Helps create type-safe collections and allows classes and methods to operate on different data types(objects) with out casting or facing runtime error.
->Avoids specifying a data type during compile time.
